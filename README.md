# ALX Data Visualization Sprint – Power BI Projects

This repository contains my work from the **Data Visualization Sprint** in the ALX Data Analytics program.  
Each part of this sprint applies **Power BI** to real-world-inspired datasets and focuses on communicating insights through impactful dashboards and storytelling.

##  Sprint Overview

In this sprint, we learn how to:

- Clean, transform, and analyze data
- Create effective visuals in Power BI
- Build dashboards for real-world decision making
- Apply storytelling techniques to data
- Use DAX, relationships, and GeoJSON mapping

The main fictional context used throughout the sprint is the city of **Maji Ndogo**, which simulates water access, budget, and population data across different provinces.
