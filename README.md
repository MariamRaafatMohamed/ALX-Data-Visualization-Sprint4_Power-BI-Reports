# ALX Data Visualization Sprint ‚Äì Power BI Projects

This repository contains my complete work from the **Visualizing Data** sprint in the ALX Data Analytics program.  
The sprint focuses on storytelling with data, building impactful visuals, and designing dashboards using **Power BI** ‚Äî all within the fictional but data-rich world of **Maji Ndogo**.

---

## Sprint Learning Objectives

Throughout this sprint, I learned to:

-  Create meaningful charts (bar, line, scatter, maps)
-  Apply storytelling principles using data
-  Transform, clean, and reshape data in Power BI
-  Write calculated columns and measures using **DAX**
-  Model data relationships (1:1, 1:many, cardinality)
-  Use **GeoJSON** maps for geographical visuals
-  Conduct exploratory analysis and communicate insights
-  Build dynamic reports with slicers, bookmarks, drilldowns

## Datasets & Files Used

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `md_summary.csv` | Core dataset with water access info |
| `.pbix` files | Power BI project files for each part |
| `map.geojson` | Custom map for Maji Ndogo provinces |
| PDF exports | Dashboards exported to PDF for presentation |
| Infographics | Visual summaries for sharing insights |

## Tools & Technologies

- **Power BI Desktop**
- Power Query Editor
- DAX (Calculated Columns & Measures)
- GeoJSON mapping
- CSV files
- Bookmarking, drill-through, and slicers
- Dashboard design principles

---

## Key Concepts Learned

- **Visual storytelling**: Using data to guide decision-making
- **Design for impact**: Accessibility, layout, color, typography
- **Interactive dashboards**: Filters, buttons, slicers, bookmarks
- **Data transformations**: Pivot/unpivot, column split, data types
- **Relationships & cardinality**: Building robust models
- **Calculated fields**: Using `SWITCH`, `RELATED`, `IF`, `CONCATENATE`
- **Aggregations with DAX**: Quick Measures, SUMX, DISTINCTCOUNT

---

## Project Context: Maji Ndogo

All projects are built around **Maji Ndogo**, a fictional city dealing with:
- Water access issues
- Queue times and infrastructure
- Gender roles in water collection
- Budget tracking and transparency

By visualizing this data, I practiced creating reports that support real-world decisions for policymakers and local leaders.
